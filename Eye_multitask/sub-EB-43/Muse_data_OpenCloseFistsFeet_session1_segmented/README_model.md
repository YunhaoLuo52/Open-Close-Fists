Run 'cls_fists.py' to train Resting and Open/Close Fists classification model.
    Best model will save as 'best_fists_model.pth' under the same directory.
    Performance plots will save as 'fists_result.png' under the same directory.
Run 'test_fists.py' to use saved model weights and reproduce the testing results.
    Performance plots will save as 'test_fists_result.png' under the same directory.


Run 'cls_feet.py' to train Resting and Open/Close Feet classification model.
    Best model will save as 'best_feet_model.pth' under the same directory.
    Performance plots will save as 'feet_result.png' under the same directory.
Run 'test_feet.py' to use saved model weights and reproduce the testing results.
    Performance plots will save as 'test_feet_result.png' under the same directory.

Still working on the script which uses single signal and the model weight to do classification.
